💥`DNI ;

🌀.ᐟ Basic dni criteria (racist,proship,etc..)

🌀.ᐟ Disrespectful people who forces their beliefs on others.
i have my own beliefs, can people just be respectful to eachother ;-;

🌀.ᐟ oc x canon haters ;-;

!! I do not have that much dnis just dont be a jerk/weirdo/an asshole in general . !!

💥`THIN ICE ;

🌀.ᐟ Randomly venting/ranting serious topics. I don't mind vent/rant but please..ask for my permission first. im not always in a mentally and physically okay condition and it can be really overwhelming for me. Ignoring this may lead to lack of response, or dry response.

🌀.ᐟ COMPETITIONS. i hate this :C
don't ever say stuff like "i love (character) more than u" or "I relate to (character) more than you" etc, It's extremely triggering for me and i don't like it.
